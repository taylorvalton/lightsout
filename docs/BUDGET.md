## Upcoming Budget Considerations

### Pump Insertion Redesign (Estimated $158K-259K CAD)

The R.Commander analysis recommends a retrofit solution that will require additional capital expenditure:

| Component | Estimated Cost (CAD) | NGen Eligible? |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| FlexiBowl 800 + Cognex 2D | $75K-116K | TBD |
| Pickit M-HD 3D Vision | $20K-34K | TBD |
| Custom Pucks (5 families) | $15K-31K | TBD |
| Robotiq 2F-85 + custom fingers | $8K-13K | TBD |
| OnRobot 3FG15 + custom fingertips | $11K-15K | TBD |
| 3D Printer (Formlabs SLS) | $14K-20K | TBD |
| Integration Engineering | $15K-30K | TBD |
| **Total** | **$158K-259K** | |
| **After NGen 37%** | **$100K-163K** | |

These costs would be distributed across Q8 and Q9 claim periods, aligning with NGen reimbursement cadence.
