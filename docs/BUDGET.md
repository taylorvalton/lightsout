#### Recommended Budget Reallocation

$125K reallocation from Sidac Materials & Supplies (only 15.2% spent, $440K unspent):

| From | To | Amount | Purpose |
|------|----|--------|---------|
| Sidac M&S | Petra Labor | $50,000 | Production staff for testing & validation |
| Sidac M&S | Petra Equipment | $30,000 | Pump insertion testing fixtures |
| Sidac M&S | Sidac Labor | $25,000 | Internal reallocation for EOAT engineering |
| Sidac M&S | Sidac Equipment | $20,000 | Internal reallocation for tooling |

Net impact: Zero — budget neutral reallocation within existing approved NGen funding.
