# LightsOut Commercialization Plan

**NGen Project 14091** | **Last Updated:** Q7 (November 2025)

---

## Overview

The LightsOut project has three distinct commercialization pathways, one per consortium partner:

1. **Petra** — Competitive advantage in contract manufacturing (use the system)
2. **Sidac** — Sell the robotic assembly solutions to other manufacturers (sell the hardware)
3. **Analytika** — Sell the AI recipe creation platform (sell the software)

## 3. Analytika — AI Recipe Creation Platform

### Market Opportunity

- **TAM:** $22.6 billion (Global AI in Manufacturing, 2030)
- **SOM in Canada:** ~$100M
- **Target capture:** 1% ($10M)
- **Total projected revenue:** $19M over 4 years

### Target Industries (Beyond Personal Care)

- Electronics Manufacturing
- Pharmaceutical Industry
- Aerospace and Defense
- Medical Device Manufacturing
- Industrial Equipment Manufacturing

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- **Phase 1:** 5 new hires; leverage Petra as case study
- **Phase 2:** Sell directly at steep discounts for training data and client exposure
- **Phase 3:** Paid media, trade shows, referral partnerships with Sidac

### Key Challenge (Q7 Update)

The AI recipe creation engine must be replicated across multiple PLC types/brands. Current development is on Petra's specific PLC; commercialization requires abstracting to support diverse manufacturing equipment.

---

## Q7 Market Update

- Tariff uncertainty is softening the marketplace, particularly for cross-border sales to the US
- Petra continues to grow domestically despite headwinds
- Sidac will reassess territory prioritization closer to commercialization
- The consortium remains confident in the long-term opportunity
