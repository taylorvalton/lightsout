# LightsOut IP Plan

**NGen Project 14091** | **Last Updated:** Q7 (November 2025)

---

## IP Ownership Framework

- **All Foreground IP is owned by Petra**, regardless of which partner invents or develops it
- Petra has sole discretion on filings, prosecution, maintenance, and enforcement
- All partners grant access to project IP to other partners for project purposes during the project
- Post-project licensing to participants on FRAND (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory) terms

**IP Counsel:** Dentons (formerly Gowling WLG) — engaged by Petra for prior art searches and FTO assessments

## Background IP (BIP)

Background IP is pre-existing intellectual property that each partner brings into the project.

| # | Asset | Owner | IP Type | Description | FTO Risk |
|---|-------|-------|---------|-------------|----------|
| BIP 1 | Mechanical Parts Aggregation | Sidac | Trade Secret | Sidac's proprietary MPA design and servo-driven mechanisms for automated parts accumulation | Low (4) |
| BIP 2 | Computer Vision Software | Sidac | Trade Secret | Sidac's existing vision computing and edge detection software for robotic guidance | Low (4) |
| BIP 3 | End of Arm Tooling | Sidac | Trade Secret | Sidac's universal EOAT designs for UR COBOTs; not unique to Petra — can adapt, change, or license if patent infringed | Medium (6) |
| BIP 4 | Production Line Workflow | Petra | Trade Secret | Petra's proprietary production line layout and workflow for contract manufacturing assembly | Low (2) |
| BIP 5 | COBOT Hardware/Software | Universal Robots | Patent + Copyright | UR5e and UR10e collaborative robot platforms; commercially licensed | Low (4) |

## Foreground IP (FIP)

Foreground IP is new intellectual property created during the project. All owned by Petra.

| # | Asset | Created By | IP Type | Protection Plan | Description |
|---|-------|-----------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| FIP 1 | Improved Computer Vision — Product Selection | Sidac (for Petra) | Copyright + Trade Secret | Maintain as trade secret | Enhanced vision algorithms for randomized product selection by COBOTs from conveyor/feeder |
| FIP 2 | Improved End of Arm Tooling | Sidac (for Petra) | Industrial Design + Patent | **File patent + industrial design** | Custom EOAT designs for 5 product categories; fingertip profiles for pump/cap gripping across 15ml-1L range |
| FIP 3 | Improved Production Line Workflow | Petra + Sidac | Trade Secret + Know-How | Maintain as trade secret | MPA redesign with custom pucks/nest plates; FlexiBowl integration; dual-vision architecture |
| FIP 4 | Closure Insertion System Data | Petra | Copyright + Trade Secret | Maintain as trade secret | Operational data, parameters, recipes generated by the pump/cap insertion system |
| FIP 5 | In-Line Inspection System Software | Analytika (for Petra) | Copyright + Trade Secret | Maintain as trade secret | QC vision inspection software that indexes incoming materials and feeds AI models |
| FIP 6 | In-Line Inspection System Data | Petra | Trade Secret + Copyright | Maintain as trade secret | Training data and inspection results from QC vision system |
| FIP 7 | Case Packing System Software | Sidac (for Petra) | Trade Secret + Copyright | Maintain as trade secret | Software for automated case packing with COBOT vision guidance |
| FIP 8 | AI Algorithms | Analytika (for Petra) | **Patent + Trade Secret** | **File patent** | CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), GD&T (Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing), Kinematic/Path Planning, Stereo Vision with PLC integration for generative recipe creation |
| FIP 9 | Case Packing System Data | Petra | Copyright + Trade Secret | Maintain as trade secret | Operational data from case packing system |

## IP Budget

| Partner | IP Budget | Planned Activities |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Petra | $20,000 | Patent filing for FIP 2 (EOAT) and FIP 8 (AI Algorithms); industrial design for FIP 2 |
| Analytika | $0 | — |
| Sidac | $0 | — |

## Freedom to Operate (FTO)

### Prior Art Search Results

Gowling WLG conducted a prior art search and found **no existing technology** matching the LightsOut system's combination of:
- Flexible robotic assembly with universal EOAT
- AI-generated PLC recipe creation from vision inspection
- Integrated Digital Twin for autonomous changeover

### FTO Assessment Schedule

| Quarter | Activity | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Q1-Q4 | Initial prior art search (Gowling WLG) | Complete |
| Q5-Q6 | Cursory IP searches for new developments | Complete |
| Q6 | Cursory search for EOAT and vision inspection patents | Complete |
| Q7 | Updated cursory search | Complete |
| Q8+ | Ongoing monitoring; formal FTO assessment before commercialization | Planned |

### Key FTO Findings

- **EOAT (FIP 2):** Commercial grippers (Robotiq, OnRobot) are commercially available; Petra's IP is in custom fingertip designs and integration methodology — protectable as trade secrets
- **AI Algorithms (FIP 8):** No direct competitors found for generative PLC recipe creation from vision inspection data; strong patent potential
- **Production Line Workflow (FIP 3):** Integration method combining FlexiBowl + Pickit + UR COBOTs + MPA is novel but uses commercial components — protectable as trade secret
